# Implementation-of-Forward-Selection-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
The code implements forward selection in sequential fashion and outputs subset of features giving minimum error while performing LDA.

DATA DESCRIPTION:

Data consists of 4601 email messages, form which 57 features have been extracted. The features are as follows: 

 • 48 features giving the percentage (0 to 100) of words in a given message that match a given word on a list that contains such words like    “business”, “free”, etc.
 
 • 6 features giving the percentage (0 to 100) of characters in the email that match a given character on a list ; ( [ ! $ # 
 
 • Feature 55 is the average length of an uninterrupted sequence of capital letters (max is 40.3, mean is 4.9).
 
 • Feature 56 is the length of the longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters (max is 45.0, mean is 52.6).
 
 • Feature 57 is the sum of the lengths of uninterrupted sequence of capital letters The class label is binary: 1= SPAM and 2 = NOT SPAM.
